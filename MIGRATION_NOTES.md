# Migration Notes

This document outlines the significant changes made during the repository rehabilitation and provides guidance for users and contributors.

## Overview of Changes

### 1. Development Environment
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` for Python, Rust, and common development files
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings
- Set up `pre-commit` hooks for code quality checks
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development setup instructions

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- Added GitHub Actions workflows for:
  - Python testing and linting
  - Rust building and testing
  - Documentation deployment
  - Security scanning
- Configured caching for faster builds
- Set up automated testing on multiple platforms

### 3. Documentation
- Set up MkDocs with Material theme
- Added comprehensive documentation structure
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking changes
- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community guidelines
- Improved `README.md` with better organization and badges

### 4. Code Quality
- Added pre-commit hooks for:
  - Code formatting (Black, isort, rustfmt)
  - Linting (flake8, mypy, clippy)
  - Security checks (git-secrets)
  - Documentation validation
- Added configuration files for linters and formatters

## Migration Steps

### For Users
1. Update your local repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Set up pre-commit hooks (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

### For Contributors
1. Follow the updated setup instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. Run tests before submitting changes:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   pytest
   cargo test
   ```

## Breaking Changes

1. **Python Version**: Now requires Python 3.11 or higher
2. **Rust Edition**: Using Rust 2021 edition
3. **Dependencies**: Some dependencies have been updated to their latest stable versions
4. **Project Structure**: Some files may have been reorganized for better organization

## Known Issues

- Some tests might fail due to the updated dependencies
- Documentation might be incomplete in some areas
- Some features might need additional configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Pre-commit Hooks Failing
If pre-commit hooks fail, you can:
1. Run the failing command manually to see detailed errors
2. Use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass hooks (not recommended)
3. Fix the issues reported by the hooks

### Test Failures
If tests fail:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Check the test output for specific error messages
3. Run tests individually to isolate the issue

### Documentation Build Issues
If documentation fails to build:
1. Ensure all Python dependencies are installed
2. Check for any syntax errors in markdown files
3. Verify that all required files exist

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add more test coverage
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Set up performance benchmarking
- [ ] Add more pre-commit hooks for additional checks
